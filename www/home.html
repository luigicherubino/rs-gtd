  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>Welcome to the <b>RealSMA Specification System.</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Project</b> - Something that consumes time, money and makes hair gray.</li>

  <h3>Interesting links to look at:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/admin">Domain Events and Commands</a> - The domain events and commands used by
    this (running) system.</li>

    <li><a href="/sitemap">Site Map</a> - No, this is not a realy site map. Sorry.. It's just the
    list of all the resources in the application.</li>

    <li><a href="/admin/projector">Projector</a> - All changes in the application are written in
    the event log. The events are then projected to read side (tables). The projecter manages the
    projections of events from the domain model. For the moment it drops and recreates tables from
    the event store.</li>
  </ul>
